    "Hexo has so many features and special effects which is cool, but also confusing. I wasn't able to easily customise it - like for the main pages which aren't part of my blog, or for displaying Jupyter Notebooks which I use a lot for making notes when learning new things.\n",
    "\n",
    "As Hexo is just a static page site generator, I decided to build my own very simplified version of it. This way I would know how every part of it worked and have complete control to make it look how I wanted. I've lost a couple of features that I can one day add back in, such as comments from Disqus, and Google Analytics tags applied to each page, also I lost all the animations. But now I can post any custom type of page I like and have made code to convert Jupyter Notebook's and display them nicely."
